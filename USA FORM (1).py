with st.expander("Understanding Coverage Metrics"):
    st.write("""
    **Coverage** in call center staffing refers to the percentage of your required staffing that you actually have available.
    
    - **100% Coverage**: You have exactly the number of agents needed to meet your service level target
    - **Below 100%**: You're understaffed and likely to miss your service level targets
    - **Above 100%**: You have more staff than needed (which may be good for unexpected spikes)
    
    The formula is:
    ```
    Coverage = (Available Agents / Required Agents) Ã— 100
    ```
    
    Higher coverage means better ability to handle calls promptly. Lower coverage means longer wait times and potentially lower service levels.
